                High contrast text can be displayed here.  The high contrast text should be used in areas where the font
                is small and has a lot of information.

                Mission statements, large headlines, or other small sections of text can go here.

                    Let's get colorful.  There are 5 different color pairings with 10 total combinations by switching
                    the foreground and background.  This will be illustrating a foreground color of #41BFB3 (green),
                    and a background color of #011826 (midnight).

                    Does this look better? I'm not sure.

                <section class="small-text fg-midnight bg-green">
                    This is a reverse color combination.  I thought it might be interesting to show
                    how much it changes the feel of the color by inversing the foreground and background.  This is very high contrast.

                    Not by much though.  The background is still set in #011826 (midnight).  The foreground has changed to #D98BA7(pink).

                    I'm not sure exactly where to use this.  It may be too loud.  Perhaps it could work well as a button.

                    Here's the last pairing with midnight.  The foreground is now #05A4B4 (blue).
                </section>
                <section class="small-text bg-midnight fg-blue">
                    Most colors will pair well with midnight due to the neutrality and darkness of the color.

                <section class="small-text bg-blue fg-midnight">
                    This isn't as loud as some of the other color choices.  Likely because it's closer to monochromatic design.
                    I still would use it more as an aside than a main html element.

            <section class="small-text">
                Let's move onto the next primary color in this design.  We can call it purple for ease.
            </section>
            <section class="large-text">
                We could call it plum too.

                <section class="small-text bg-purple fg-green">
                    The colors clash a little bit.  I really don't know where I would use this, however, it is high contrast.
                    This is likely because the color #591C38 (purple) has more red than blue, and the green are complimentary.

                    This may be better.

                    I'm not sure how well this communicates our space theme though.  Probably better than a purple or plum background.

                    Using a pink foreground is better.

                    This may be good for secondary buttons on the page.  Or an aside.

                    It's getting loud again.

                    However, it still is less loud than mixing purple and green.  This would be a good primary button I think.
